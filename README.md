# Java_Quiz_Project
A scenario-based Java program with functionality for both ADMIN and STUDENT login is presented in this repository. The user can either generate questions or participate in the quiz exam depending on whether he is a student or an administrator. Once the exam is over, the results will be displayed. An error message will appear if someone attempts to log in using improper credentials. Two distinct JSON files contain the quiz questions and user credentials...
